**Description**:

- This project systematically analyses the ethical issues related to the use of AI in assisting radiologists to detect breast cancer, from the perspectives of safety, privacy, fairness, and transparency, and from the processes of data collection, model training, and inference, with reference to technical reports, UNESCO recommendations, and the Australian Privacy Principles (APP). Furthermore, it outlines the potential solutions for computer scientists, governments, medical institutes, and patients.
- Key safety issues include: reduced human radiologist attention and skills at work, corruption of model parameters, and the lack of a model performance standard.
- Key privacy issues include: the secondary use of data for subsequent model training that is not mentioned in the original informed consent, the under-anonymisation of training data and model parameters that can reflect the attributes of a specific individual, and the sharing of data and results with countries under different privacy laws.
- Key fairness issues include: the accessibility of outcomes in low-income and developing countries, and the imbalance in datasets, which affects model performance for minority groups.
- Key transparency issues include: the closed-source nature of commercial models, the non-interpretability, and the complexity of deep learning models.
- Other issues include: responsibility for false-negative detection and energy consumption.
- The suggestions for computer scientists include: data encryption and checksum for data warehouse and model parameters, data collection from minority groups, intrinsic and posthoc global and local interpretability evaluation for AI models, and enhancement of AI ethics education.
- The suggestions for governments include: the establishment of standards and the issuance of certificates; the clarification of responsibility for AI-related tasks; the sharing of technology with low-income or remote regions; the inspection of closed-source AI models; the encouragement of open source; and the promotion of renewable energy.
- The suggestions for medical institutes include: clear consent forms for patients that cover data collection, training, and inference processes, with an expiration date; enhancing radiologists’ understanding of the underlying principles of AI; and consolidating the double-reading procedure involving AI assistance.
- The suggestions for individual patients include increased awareness that data may be shared in many unconscious ways.
- The study also acknowledges the complexity of many issues, where solving one could potentially yield others, and hence a balance point needs to be set.
